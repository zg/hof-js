Higher-order functions in JavaScript.

I have written this small library of functions as a learning experience for myself based off of other resources that I have found these in.  Some of these functions are from [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net) exercises, lodash, Java, and even JavaScript itself, reimplemented by me.
